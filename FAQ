1. How to run CALID - pair wise comparison algorithm to watch given folders every 5 minute?

The given folders are /home/me/input/RAD1 and /home/me/input/RAD2, we want to compare
the lowest elevation which is 0.5 degree, minimal reflectivity is 3.0dBZ and precision
 of overlapping pixel (distance between overlapping pixels from each radars) is 500m.

$ jrat -i /home/me/input/RAD1 /home/me/input/RAD2 --calid ele=0.5 dis=500 ref=3.0 --seq 5

If folders are not empty, aplication will ask for confirmation to delete
all files after processing them. It will ask only once. Aplication will activate every
5 minutes (in rounded time e.g. 00, 05, 10, 15 etc.), first run will start imedietly.

2. When using CALID, how can I watch three Radars with different settings?

Using --calid-opt and valid xml file. You can define setting for each radar separately.

$ jrat --calid-opt file.xml --calid --seq 10
